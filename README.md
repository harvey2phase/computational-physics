# Projects in Computational Physics

This is project for me to investigate some topics in computational and theoretical physics, including numerical programming and quantum computing.

I hope to experiment and bridge the knowledge gap between my two areas of study in university, computer science and physics.

Some of these projects are based on assignments from the Computer Simulation in Science course (Fall 2017) at Dalhousie University.

## Goals

My goals include the investigation of the following topics:
* Methods and algorithms in numerical programming
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Differentiation and integration
    * System of linear equation
    * Ordinary Differential Equations
    * Partial Differential Equations
* Comparison between different Programming languages in the context of physics and numerical programming
    * Python
    * C
    * C++
    * Pascal
* Quantum computing
    * Numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation
    * Simulation of wavepackets

## Installing and Testing

To install, simply download the project as a zip file or clone the repository using the following Bash command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/harveytwoface/CompPhysics.git
```
